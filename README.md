# ✈️ Airfare Prediction and Optimization with PySpark

This project explores how airfare pricing can be predicted and optimized using historical flight data and big data technologies.

We developed a predictive model using Apache Spark (PySpark) and applied Gradient Boosted Trees to forecast airfares, discover influential features, and explore optimization strategies that could be used by airlines to maximize revenue.

## 🚀 Highlights
- Built scalable pipelines using PySpark for cleaning, feature engineering, and model training.
- Used GBTRegressor achieving **R² = 0.99** and **RMSE = 12.60**.
- Investigated feature importance: time to departure, route, seasonality, layovers, and demand patterns.
- Explored price elasticity and strategies for dynamic pricing.

## 📦 Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Apache Spark (PySpark)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `pyspark`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
